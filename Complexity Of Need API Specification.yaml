    A microservice which holds the Complexity of Need level associated with offenders

    ### Authentication

    This API is secured by OAuth 2 with tokens supplied by HMPPS Auth.

    Read permissions are granted to clients with the role `ROLE_COMPLEXITY_OF_NEED`

    Write permissions are granted to clients with the role `ROLE_UPDATE_COMPLEXITY_OF_NEED`.

          - will exclude offenders without a current active level
